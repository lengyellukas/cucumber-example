# Example of BDD project using Cucumber
inspired by Pluralsight course by Catalin Tudose - Java: BDD Fundamentals

The project is a simple implementation of an airline booking system. The goal was to test two new features:
- Bonus policy feature
- Passenger policy feature

The tests are run from **RunCucumberTest** class. This project is an example of testing using Gherkin and Cucumber.
